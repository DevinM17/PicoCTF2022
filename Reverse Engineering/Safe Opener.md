# Reverse Engineering â€“ Safe Opener
## Description
Can you open this safe? I forgot the key to my safe but this [program](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/463/SafeOpener.java) is supposed to help me with retrieving the lost key. Can you help me unlock my safe? Put the password you recover into the picoCTF flag format like: `picoCTF{password}`

## Breaking it down
We have another reverse engineering challenge that has us digging into the programs code. Start by downloading the SafeOpener.java file and open it with a text editor of your choice.

## Step 1 | Finding the encoded password
In the source code we can see a string encoded key which has a value which is unreadable at first. Lets copy that value and see if we can manage to decode it. If we do that we may have our flag.

## Step 2 | Cooking with CyberChef
Using Cyber Chefs magic recipe I can see the value is most likely base64 encoded, when using a decoder we are presented with a password which is also out flag!

Flag = picoCTF{pl3as3_l3t_m3_1nt0_th3_saf3}
