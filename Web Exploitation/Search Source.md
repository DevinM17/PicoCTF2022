# Web Exploitation - Search Source
## Description
The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it? The website is [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:61941/)

## Provided Hints (1)
How could you mirror the website on your local machine so you could use more powerful tools for searching?

## Breaking it down
Based on the description we can infer the artifact that was left behind may be our flag. Looking at the title it can be assumed this artifact will be found in the websites source code. Now using our hint, we can get our last look into how to solve this thing. The hint suggests we may need to mirror the website onto our local machine so we can use a more powerful tool. Our first step should be looking into mirroring the site.

## Step 1 | Mirroring the site
If you have never mirrored a website before, SysTutorials has a great step by step guide on how to do this which can be found [here](https://www.systutorials.com/how-to-mirror-a-website-using-wget-on-linux/). You may use the wget command often to download files but, the --mirror command can be used to mirror a site. Use the following command to mirror this specific website `wget --mirror http://saturn.picoctf.net:61941/`

## Step 2 | What tool to use?
Now that we have the site mirrored, we can access all of the files and find this artifact. We could do this manually but, this would take a long time so itâ€™s a good idea to research some tools that can do it automatically for us. LinOxide has a list of 6 tools which can be used to search source code found [here](https://linoxide.com/search-tools-developers-linux/), these would mainly be used for developers, but it can be useful for us in this case. Second on this list is ag, we will use that.

## Step 3 | The search
Since we have decided on a command to use, and we already have the source code downloaded we can run the following command `ag pico` which will search all the files for the word "Pico". As we can see in the css style banner the flag was found.
