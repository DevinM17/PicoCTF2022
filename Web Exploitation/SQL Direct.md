What does a SQL database contain?

## Breaking it down
We should be able to connect to the SQL server, find out what tables are in the database and then list the contents of them to find the flag.

## Step 1 | Finding the Table
Once we have connected, we can use the following command to list the tables in the database `\dt`. It can be seen that there is one table in the database with the name "flags".

## Step 2 | Listing the contents
Now that we know the name of the table we want to list out the contents of we enter the following: `SELECT * FROM flags;` this query selects all items from the flags table and prints it out. We can see the first item has an address that looks an awful lot like a flag.

Flag = picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_21c94904}
