## Provided Hints (1)
Do you know how to modify cookies?

## Breaking it down
We are given a link to a website and a hint which points us in the direction of modifying a cookie in our browser.  For this challenge you can use an extension of your choice to modify a cookie, I will be using `Cookie Quick Manager` which is a Firefox extension.

## Step 1 | Viewing website
We are presented with a webstie which is an "Online Gradebook" and there is a button which allows us to continue as guest.

## Step 2 | Website behavior
The next step in solving this challenge is understanding this websties behavior, for example lets click the "continue as guest" button and see what happens. We are brought to another page which says the following "We apologize, but we have no guest services at the moment". 

## Step 3 | Viewing and modifying cookies
Now that we know there is no guest services on this site, lets open the cookie manager extension and see what cookies are associtated with this site. I can see one cookie which is called "isAdmin" and the value is set to 0 or False. Lets change the value to 1 or True and see if that changes the sites behavior. 

## Step 4 | Refreshing page
Now that the cookie "isAdmin" has been set to 1 or "True" lets try refreshing the site and see if anything has changed. Once we refresh the site we are given the flag.
