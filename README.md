# PicoCTF 2022
## What is it?
Pico runs an annual capture the flag event in which teams compete to gain the most points by completing challenges in different categories such as Forensics, Cryptography, Web exploitation, etc. 

## My Experience
At the time of writing this I am finishing my second year of Computer Security and Investigations at Fleming College. This was my first time competing in the Pico CTF but, my third time competing in a CTF. Capture the flag events help to build on ones cyber security skills and during this event I thought I could gain a lot from doing a writeup for each challenge I completed.

## My Team
PicoCTF allowed for up to teams of 5 and myself along side 4 of my classmates all participated in this event. The team consisted of The_Forensic_Fish (me), Mukk, LAINN, Joeyh625, and CockroachKing.

## Team Score and Placement
Each challenge varies in terms of the amount of points rewarded, the harder the challenge the more points you get. By the end of the 2 weeks my team had managed to get 4700 points. All this while completing are usual school work throughout the two weeks is very impressive! We placed 1969/7794 on the global leaderboards.
